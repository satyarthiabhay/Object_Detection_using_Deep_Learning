# Object_Detection_using_Deep_Learning
A major challenge in many of the object detection systems is the dependency on other computer vision techniques for helping the deep learning-based approach, which leads to slow and non optimal performance. In this project, a completely deep learning-based approach to solve the problem of object detection is used. The resulting system will be fast and accurate
